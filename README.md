# Classification-of-working-modes-of-dual-branch-Swin-Transformer-block-ciphers
We propose a hard voting classification model for block cipher working mode based on an improved dual-branch Swin-Transformer and adaptive image enhancement.
1.The multi-key IV combination experiment involves changing the keys and IVs used to generate the base ciphertext. The model remains the main model and has already been presented. Therefore, the source code for this part will not be repeated.
